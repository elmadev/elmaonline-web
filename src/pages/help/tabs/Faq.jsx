          Q: Why should I use EOL instead of the Steam version?
        </QuestionText>
        <AnswerText>
          A: EOL (Elma Online) enhances the game with online capabilities, such
          as the ability to see other players playing the same level, saving all
          stats in a database and playing live battles in-game, along with the
          chat.

          Q: I have a feature suggestion. Who should I tell about it?
        </QuestionText>
        <AnswerText>
          A: The Elma discord in general is a good place to discuss just about
          anything related to this game. Keep in mind the eol patch itself is
          hard and a lot of work to update which might make even good ideas not
          easy to implement.

        <QuestionText>Q: How do I know the time of a replay?</QuestionText>
        <AnswerText>
          A: In the replay menu, press ctrl + alt + enter. This will show the
          time of the replay within small error margin.

          Q: I get &quot;tcp: can&#39;t connect to the server&quot; when I
          launch the game
        </QuestionText>
        <AnswerText>
          A: Usually this error occurs when something is wrong in your
          connection settings. Make sure your nick, password, server IP and
          ports are correct. If you get both &quot;Connected to the server&quot;
          and &quot;Error: lost tcp connection to server (F12 to
          Reconnect)&quot; your IP and TCP ports should be correct.

          Q: I get &quot;Error: udp bind&quot;. What does it mean?
        </QuestionText>
        <AnswerText>
          Usually this error occurs when you have multiple instances of the game
          running simultaneously. Close the extra executables and you should be
          good to go.
