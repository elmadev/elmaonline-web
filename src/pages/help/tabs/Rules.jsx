      Disobeying the rules will get you a warning or ban in that particular
      category. This means you can have multiple warnings at once in different
      categories. Some minor offenses might be overlooked the first couple of
      times, but serious offenses will give immediate bans without warnings. The
      banning tiers are as follows. The 2 week ban is repeatable which means
      that minor offenses won&#39;t make you jump to the 1 year tier of ban.
      Website offenses will result in playing bans.
      <ul>
        <li>1st time: Warning</li>
        <li>2nd time: 1 week ban</li>
        <li>3rd time: 2 week ban (repeatable)</li>

        A few lines of non english here and there will be allowed. If you are
        bad at english or talking to someone who is, it&#39;s fine to talk in
        another language shortly. But if it turns into a longer conversation
        move it to private or elsewhere.

      Allowed:
      <ul>
        <li>New levels never played by anyone</li>
        <ul>
          Remixes
          <li>Internal remixes</li>
          <li>Remixes of others&#39; levels</li>
          <li>
            But remember they have to be noticably different, especially when
            it&#39;s internals (changing polygons required). And keep amount of
            remixes to a minimum.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      Not allowed:
      <ul>
        <li>Remixes only changing the starting position</li>

        <li>Practice(/Train) levels</li>

      <p>
        You should always use your &quot;official&quot; nick, as in the nick you
        usually use, and the team you&#39;re a member of if any.
      </p>
      <Header h2>Final word</Header>
      <p>
        The admin group always has the final word, however if you feel
        you&#39;re being treated unjustly, you can send a ban appeal and another
        admin will look at it. Serious cases will always be discussed in the
        admin group.

      <Header h2>Starting battles</Header>
      <p>
        When you register you do not have rights to start battles. This is for
        you to learn what a battle is before starting one, and to avoid new
        players accidentally starting one. To get battle rights you currently
        need to contact a mod, the easiest way is using the{' '}
        <a href="https://discord.gg/j5WMFC6">discord</a> and finding someone
        with the eolmod role.
      </p>
      <Header h3>Types</Header>
      <p>
        There are three types of battle starting rights. You can have multiple
        at once.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Normal (Normal, One-life, First Finish, Slowness, Survivor, Last
            Counts, Finish-count, Crippled, 1-60 minutes duration)
          </li>
          <li>
            Special (1 hour TT, Flag Tag, Apple, Speed, Drunk, Apple Bugs,
            Multi)
          </li>
          <li>Long (65-180 minutes duration)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <Header h3>Requirements</Header>
      <p>
        Requirements to obtain battle rights are put in place to make sure you
        understand how to use them. Exceptions can be made if this can be
        verified otherwise.
        <ul>
          <li>Normal: Play five battles, ask a mod.</li>
          <li>Special: Start five battles, ask a mod.</li>
          <li>Long: Start 50 battles, ask a mod.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <Header h3>Guidelines</Header>
      <p>
        Since battles are started serially using a queue, starting a battle
        affects what people can play and how much room there is for others to
        start battles. Don't let that stop you, just keep it in mind when
        starting many battles, especially special and long battles. Long battles
        over 60 minutes are recommended to not be started more than once a week
        and to be preannounced in{' '}
        <a href="https://discord.gg/j5WMFC6">discord</a> or{' '}
        <a href="https://mopolauta.moposite.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=7132">
          mopolauta
        </a>
        . Long battles are still new and experimental, rights may be taken away
        so you have to ask again.
